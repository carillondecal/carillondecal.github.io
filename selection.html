				<hr></hr>
				<p>
				We don't believe that any of the carillon players who review applications really are justified in making a judgement on differentiating between who does/doesn't deserve a spot, so we try to keep the application review process somewhat systematic and mostly removed from personal opinion.
				<br>
				<br>
				First, we look at repeat applicants, and provided they exhibit a baseline level of enthusiasm for what the class entails (i.e. attended a concert, talked about what they wanted to do/why they wanted to play the instrument), we accept them in order of earliest applicant to latest.
				<br>
				<br>
				Then, if there's still space (this semester, the class was filled almost exclusively by repeat applicants), we look at first time applicants. We put them into a lottery system (which places no preference on submission time/date), then review the randomly chosen applications and make sure that they again exhibit a certain level of enthusiasm for trying to learn the instrument. This continues until the class is full.
				<br>
				<br>
				Last semester, we had upwards of 90 applicants and only 10 spots to offer, so it really just boils down to a numbers game for first time applicants. Almost everyone who applies has what it takes to get into the class, but we sadly can't make space for them all.
